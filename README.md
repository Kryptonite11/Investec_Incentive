# Investec_Incentive
Companies are looking for a way to recognize and reward high performing employees or teams in an elective manner with low technological barrier to entry.


To setup the solution, the user would need node.js and the required packages to be installed. 

The solution uses a MongoDB database to store the required tables

The "Transaction API" was simulated with the Investec Programmable Card (see video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdOtp5hbuEU)


The user would need to replace the Investec Open API token with their own, this code was removed for security purposes
